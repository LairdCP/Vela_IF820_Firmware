This folder contains the V1.1.1 host API protocol reference library release
files for implementing host-side application logic in designs built around the
EZ-Serial BLE Firmware platform release V1.1.1. The protocol version implemented
in these files is V1.3.

- ezsapi.json: Javascript Object Notation (JSON) definition containing all
               relevant protocol structures
               
- ezsapi.c/.h: Generic C implementation of the API protocol, suitable for
               reference or porting to any C-based platform
               
- ezslib.py:   Python implementation of the API protocol, suitable for reference
               or any Python-capable host; tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5
               
- cy8ckit-042-psoc4: Folder containing an example project which implements
                     basic API communication from the CY8CKIT-042 Pioneer kit
                     to an externally connected CYBLE module running EZ-Serial
                     firmware.
