The "EZSLib" folder should be copied into the Arduino "libraries" subfolder of
the main sketch folder on your computer. This is usually named "Arduino" and
placed within your user/documents folder. For example:

C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\libraries\

Once you have placed the folder there, (re)start the Arduino IDE to ensure the
libraries folder has been scanned correctly. You can open the provided example
sketches through the File -> Examples -> EZSLib -> Examples -> ... menu tree.
